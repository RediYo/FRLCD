# H0H1

The goal of the situational test is to collect realistic Bluetooth RSSI data between an iPhone and another phone (iPhone or Android) for a period of time at two different distances (i.e. within transmission distance, and a safe distance away) while the testers go about their daily lives in a variety of environmental
conditions.

In the H0 test, the testers are asked to remain 10 ft. or more apart for 15 minutes while interacting with each other. Another test, the H1 test, will have the testers stay within 6 ft. of each other for the same duration. Testers can be in any environment they choose such as walking outside, talking across a table, or sitting across the room from each other. The testers may also use the phones as they wish throughout the test.

Testers are to be family/house members who are isolating in the same residence together. Social distancing between non-members should be observed.
